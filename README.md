## Part 1 - GitHub Access

Commit which identifies the solution to this part: bf944d30d144e70019e2a4b3d102234f17ec43b6

A little program under _/Github-acess_ demonstrates the use of Eclipse EGit Github library for Java to retrieve and display data about a Github's user repositories and the number of "watchers" for these public repositories. In this case, data about myself is retrieved and displayed. More details can be found in README in the directory of the program.

The program is built using Apache Maven with a POM included in the directory. The program was built and ran using Eclipse Photon with Maven M2E plugin.
