## GitHub Access

Task: _Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer._

A little program here demonstrates the use of Eclipse EGit Github library for Java to retrieve and display data about a Github's user repositories and the number of "watchers" for these ppublic repositories. In this case, data about myself is retrieved and displayed.
The results of running the program: ![console screenshot](/Github-access/images/github-basic-access-console-screenshot.png "Public repositories and watchers.")
